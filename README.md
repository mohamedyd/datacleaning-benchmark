# datacleaning-benchmark

What's missing

* Noise models, model eval
* Base Data representation and how to corrupt it


Noise

* Constraint based noise
  * white does an input file of constraints look like
  * given a constraint how to generate errors
  * gvine a set of constraints, how to generate errors
* Constraint based noise + synthetic noise
* Graphics of celaning opertations and applying subpaths in tnhe graph
* Samples of ground truth

What to evaluate

* Constraint based stuff
* Chris Re's stuff
* Active clean
* Normal models


How to use our benchmark in existing data cleaning system/exepreiment setups

* walk through

Benchmarks to look at
